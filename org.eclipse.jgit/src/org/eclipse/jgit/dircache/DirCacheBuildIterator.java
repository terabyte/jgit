/**
 * Iterate and update a {@link DirCache} as part of a <code>TreeWalk</code>.
 * <p>
 * Like {@link DirCacheIterator} this iterator allows a DirCache to be used in
 * parallel with other sorts of iterators in a TreeWalk. However any entry which
 * appears in the source DirCache and which is skipped by the TreeFilter is
 * automatically copied into {@link DirCacheBuilder}, thus retaining it in the
 * newly updated index.
 * <p>
 * This iterator is suitable for update processes, or even a simple delete
 * algorithm. For example deleting a path:
 *
 * <pre>
 * final DirCache dirc = db.lockDirCache();
 * final DirCacheBuilder edit = dirc.builder();
 *
 * final TreeWalk walk = new TreeWalk(db);
 * walk.reset();
 * walk.setRecursive(true);
 * walk.setFilter(PathFilter.create(&quot;name/to/remove&quot;));
 * walk.addTree(new DirCacheBuildIterator(edit));
 *
 * while (walk.next())
 * 	; // do nothing on a match as we want to remove matches
 * edit.commit();
 * </pre>
