/**

 * further through history. Applications that want to lay annotations down text
 * to the original source file in a viewer may find the BlameResult structure an
 * easy way to acquire the information, at the expense of keeping tables in
 * memory tracking every line of the result file.
 * <p>
 * This class is not thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * During blame processing there are two files involved:
 * <ul>
 * <li>result - The file whose lines are being examined. This is the revision
 * the user is trying to view blame/annotation information alongside of.</li>
 * <li>source - The file that was blamed with supplying one or more lines of
 * data into result. The source may be a different file path (due to copy or
 * rename). Source line numbers may differ from result line numbers due to lines
 * being added/removed in intermediate revisions.</li>
 * </ul>
