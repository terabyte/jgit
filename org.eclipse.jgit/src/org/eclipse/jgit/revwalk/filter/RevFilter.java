/**
 * Selects interesting revisions during walking.
 * <p>
 * This is an abstract interface. Applications may implement a subclass, or use
 * one of the predefined implementations already available within this package.
 * Filters may be chained together using <code>AndRevFilter</code> and
 * <code>OrRevFilter</code> to create complex boolean expressions.
 * <p>
 * Applications should install the filter on a RevWalk by
 * {@link RevWalk#setRevFilter(RevFilter)} prior to starting traversal.
 * <p>
 * Unless specifically noted otherwise a RevFilter implementation is not thread
 * safe and may not be shared by different RevWalk instances at the same time.
 * This restriction allows RevFilter implementations to cache state within their
 * instances during {@link #include(RevWalk, RevCommit)} if it is beneficial to
 * their implementation. Deep clones created by {@link #clone()} may be used to
 * construct a thread-safe copy of an existing filter.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Message filters:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Author name/email: {@link AuthorRevFilter}</li>
 * <li>Committer name/email: {@link CommitterRevFilter}</li>
 * <li>Message body: {@link MessageRevFilter}</li>
